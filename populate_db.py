One modern one I really liked that not as many people have seen is 'The Night House'. It's a slow burn but really effective. More psychological than jump-scare based.",

The Elder Scrolls series (Especially Morrowind and Skyrim) were awesome. The Baldur's Gate series took up a lot of my time as a kid, and more recently, the 3rd one was great. Speaking of Baldur's Gate, I love that old isometric style of RPG, so I looked for more modern equivalents and found Pillars of Eternity, which was fantastic. Also both Pathfinder: Kingmaker and Wrath of the Righteous were a lot of fun as well.",

As silly as it sounds, that movie is actually one of the main reasons I decided to pursue an internship at NASA back in college. After that internship, I found I had a craving to learn and do more. It pushed me to take programming more seriously, which eventually led me to where I am today... Which is writing a blog post about FastAPI that's just meant to fill space. TLDR: I watched Gattaca and now I'm writing sample blog posts at 3am on a Saturday for this FastAPI tutorial. And you can too!",
